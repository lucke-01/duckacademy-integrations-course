# Server-Sent Events (SSE) with Spring Boot and Flux

## Overview
This project implements **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** using **Spring Boot** and **Project Reactor's Flux** to enable real-time, event-driven communication. SSE allows servers to push continuous updates to clients over a single HTTP connection, making it ideal for real-time applications.

## Features
- **Spring Boot** for easy application configuration
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for efficient one-way communication from server to client
- **Reactor Flux** for handling reactive streams of data
- **Non-blocking, event-driven architecture** for scalability

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- **Java 21+**
- **Maven** for dependency management
